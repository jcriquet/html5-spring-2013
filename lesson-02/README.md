For this exercise, I decided to use a blog project that I had started 2 years ago.  I first cleaned up a bunch of the html and css to remove a few of the errors.  There's still more of that I can do though (such as replace the semi-transparent background div).  I removed a lot of the useless code that is redudent such as in the DOCTYPE and various elements in the head block.  Next, I started placing header, footer, section, aside, nav and article tags in the body where seemed appropriate.  While none of this made any visual changes, the outlining and disability portion of my blog has been vastly improved.

I look forward to next week!
