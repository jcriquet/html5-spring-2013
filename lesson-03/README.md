So, I spent quite a while on this assignment.  I like everything that you can do with CSS3!  I think I made a pretty neat showcase page and I'm very happy with it.  Didn't have time to update my blog but I'm sure I'll get to that next week.

Thanks for all the amazing resources!

Here's the assignment online: http://student.santarosa.edu/~jcriquet/html5/
